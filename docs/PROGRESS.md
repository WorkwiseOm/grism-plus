# Progress — Grism Plus

## Backlog

- Data classification modelled as Postgres enum (public/internal/confidential/restricted) — adequate for MVP and SOC 2 readiness. Consider promoting to a reference table if per-classification metadata (handling rules, retention defaults, UI colours) becomes needed. Tracked as post-MVP item.
- Session idle timeout enforcement — Step 4 deliverable. Supabase Auth's `inactivity_timeout` is Pro-tier only; enforce in Next.js middleware that checks time-since-`last_activity_at` against `tenants.idle_timeout_minutes` on every authenticated request and forces re-auth past threshold.
- Rate limiting (5 failed sign-ins per 15-minute rolling window per IP) — Step 4 deliverable. Next.js middleware with pg-backed counter keyed on IP and outcome=failure. Supabase Auth native `sign_in_sign_ups` left at default 30/5-min as safety net (Option B).
- Pseudonym collision space — current 4-hex-char pseudonyms provide 65,536 unique values. Birthday-paradox collision probability reaches ~50% at ~300 employees per tenant. Risk: AI conflates two employees with same pseudonym in a single coaching brief. Step 4 deliverable: expand to 8 hex chars (4.3B values, collision-negligible at enterprise scale) OR use sequential pseudonym IDs stored per-session (no collision possible, traceable, reversible for debugging).
- Supabase Pro tier upgrade — unlocks Time-box user sessions, Inactivity timeout, and other session controls. Revisit in Phase 4 when scoping production deployment or when a client security review specifically demands it.
- Incident response runbook — Phase 4 deliverable. Scope with Grism JSC and first pilot client security review input. Skeleton now would be speculative and would likely need full rewrite later.
- MFA enforcement UI and enrolment flow — Step 4 deliverable. Will check tenants.mfa_required_roles array at login and gate ld_admin/superadmin roles on MFA completion.
